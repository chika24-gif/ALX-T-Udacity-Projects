# Ford GoBike Data Exploration

## Dataset

After Cleaning, The dataset consists of over 170000 observations of individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area. 

## Summary of the Findings
The main focus of this exploration was on trip duration how trip duration varies among the main categorical variables in this dataset which includes the member gender, the user type, the days of the week and the Bike Share for all.

plotting the distribution of trip duration on logarithmic scale and choosing a better upper bound suggested by the dataset, the trip duration follows a normal distribution. the majority of the trips in our dataset falls between 4 and 20 minutes.
After plotting the age distribution of the riders in the dataset, it was discovered that majority of our riders are between the age of 25 years and 45 years.
It was also discovered that most of the trips are made in the morning and the evening specifically, 17:00 and 8:00 respectively and most trips are made during the weekdays than the weekends, but most long rides were taken during the weekends, this suggests that most of our riders who uses the bike share during the weekdays uses the bike share as a means of transportation to and from their various workplaces.
it was also discovered that among the genders, the males are associated with long rides in terms of trip duration, also the customer user types and those who didn't subscribe for the bike for all trip are associated with longer rides than the subscriber user types and those who did subscribe for the bike share for all program.

## Key Insights for Presentations
For the presentation, I focused on the trip duration and how it varies with the main categorical variables, I started by show the distribution of the trip duration in seconds and in minutes, I then proceeded by presenting the boxplots where I showed the trip variations in the th ,ain categorical variables, the gender, the user type, the bike share for all trip, the weekdays, and the hour.
I further grouped by these categorical variables and took the average trip durations and represented them in barplots.
